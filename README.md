In this project we were tasked to create to do app to organzie our life by creating a task and setting a level of priority for it. Was a fun project to use bootstrap for the overall design and we had to use AngularJS for the functionality. I used AngularJS features of two way binding, ng-click for for click events and ng-repeat to iterate the information on a table. Angular filters was something new that I learned on this project to change the display of my data that was made which I found very cool and useful.
